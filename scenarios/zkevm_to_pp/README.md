# zkEVM to PP

- The run.sh tries to reproduce through a shadow fork of both L1 and L2 the process for migrating zkEVM Mainnet to PP.
- The run-messed.sh approach tries to sequence and verify as well on the shadow fork, but that caused issues due to the sequencer's address swap required, because we don't have the real keystores. But anyway I'd say it could be interesting to keep it for future reference.
