# 2. receiver_addr: The address of the receiver
# 3. amount: The amount of native tokens to send (in wei)
# 4. rpc_url: The RPC URL of the Ethereum network
# The function will attempt to send the specified amount of native tokens to the receiver address.
# If the transaction fails, it will retry up to 3 times with a 3-second delay between attempts.
