The TLDR for getting started is that these tests are based on a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol][TAP]]
compatible tool called [[https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core][Bats]]. All of the tests are small bash
scripts. If the test exits with a non-zero exit code, the test
fails. If you're new to bash or Bats, these are some useful links.

* How to run your test

The tests in this repository depend on an external RPC which can be
specified via environment variables. If you're testing locally, using
the [[https://github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk/releases/tag/v0.3.4][kurtosis-cdk]] is probably the easiest way to get started.

#+begin_src bash
# from within the kurtosis cdk-repo
kurtosis run --enclave cdk --args-file .github/tests/combinations/fork12-cdk-erigon-sovereign.yml .
#+end_src

With a network in place, if you'd like to run a single test file, or use Bats directly, it's
pretty easy as well:

#+begin_src bash
# You'll want to set whatever environment variables your test needs. If you want to use defaults you could skip this.
set -a
source tests/.env
set +a

# Some tests will use helpers. If your test does, you'll want to add that to the bats lib path.
export BATS_LIB_PATH="$PWD/core/helpers/lib"

# Now you can run bats
bats tests/agglayer/bridges.bats --filter-tags agglayer,rpc
#+end_src

If you just want to run like CI does, you can use the following command:

#+begin_src bash
act --container-options "--group-add $(stat -c %g /var/run/docker.sock)" -s GITHUB_TOKEN=$ACT_GITHUB_TOKEN workflow_call
#+end_src

* Philosophy and Goals

*Separation of concerns* between infrastructure and test logic is a
major goal of this project. We want to have a wide variety of
tests. The tests themselves shouldn't be concerned with the details of
the infrastructure on which the execute. A single test should be
configurable based on environment variables and should be able to run
against a Kurtosis devnet or a mainnet RPC.

Ideally this repository is *self documenting*. For our test cases,
that means they should be thoughtfully [[Test Case Naming][named]] and [[Thinking about tagging][tagged]]. In the case
of a failure, the error messaging and naming should be it very clear
what failed and what it might mean.

#+begin_src bash
# Bad example
@test "send bridge" {
    if ! bridge ; then {
        echo "bridge failed"
        exit 1
    }
}

# Better example
@test "bridge native eth from l1 to l2" {
    if ! bridge ; then {
        echo "Bridge deposit was not claimed despite being finalized on L1. Check that bridge service is running properly"
        exit 1
    }
}
#+end_src

The "better" example above has a descriptive name that indicates what
type of bridge is being tested. It also has a lot more context if and
when there is a failure.

Another major goal of this project is to have a *simple developer
experience*. Making that happen isn't easy, but we want to have shared
[[Thinking about environment variables][environment variables]] that are common across test cases. Similarly, we
want to have tags and a project layout that's intuitive.

* Thinking about environment variables

As a test developer, you can define whatever environment variables you
like, but in order for the test cases to be executed via generic
automations, it's critical that you're aware of commonly used
environment variables and to use them whenever possible.

| Variable              | Purpose                                                            |
|-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RPC_URL               | A generic JSON RPC URL for tests that do not require L1/L2 context |
| L1_RPC_URL            | An RPC URL that serves as the L1 for some rollup or validium       |
| L2_RPC_URL            | An RPC URL for a rollup that's anchored on L1                      |
| PRIVATE_KEY           | A private key that's funded for RPC_URL                            |
| L1_PRIVATE_KEY        | A private key that's funded for L1_RPC_URL                         |
| L2_PRIVATE_KEY        | A private key that's funded for L2_RPC_URL                         |
| SEQUENCER_RPC_URL     | An RPC URL that's directly connected to a sequencer                |
| GAS_TOKEN_ADDR        | The L1 address of a custom gas token                               |
| BRIDGE_SERVICE_URL    | The URL of the bridge service used for claiming deposits           |
| L1_BRIDGE_ADDR        | The address of the bridge on L1                                    |
| L2_BRIDGE_ADDR        | The address of the bridge on L2                                    |
| LEGACY_MODE           | If true, don't send a type 2 transaction                           |
| KURTOSIS_ENCLAVE_NAME | Specifies the enclave name used in some defaults                   |


A few points on the design and thinking. In general, we're going to
*prefer deriving* rather than specifying everything. Rather than
specifying an ~L1_ETH_ADDRESS~ variable that can be set, we would
derive this value from the ~L1_PRIVATE_KEY~. Similarly, rather than
specifying the [[https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/blob/98b8b1f0af6074d5e2cf6b6c223db99d1f3e29f3/contracts/v2/PolygonZkEVMBridgeV2.sol#L61][~networkID~]] with something like ~L2_NETWORK_ID~, we
would rather read this value from the bridge.

The test cases aren't meant for a specific environment, but in many
cases the default values for environment variables will target the
[[https://github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk][kurtosis-cdk]] package or the [[https://github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-polygon-pos][kurtosis-polygon-pos]] package. For example,
if you startup the kurtosis package like this:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk --args-file .github/tests/combinations/fork12-cdk-erigon-sovereign.yml .
#+end_src

Many tests will assume the default target of the test is kurtosis and
define the keys and URLs accordingly.

* Test Case Naming

Consistent and clear test naming is critical for maintaining
readability, ensuring searchability, and improving test result
clarity. We will enforce these naming standards during code review to
maintain consistency across our test suite.  Naming Standard

Each test should follow this pattern:

#+begin_src bats
@test "<action> <test scope> <conditions or properties> [expected outcome]"
#+end_src

Where:

- ~<action>~ – What the test is *doing* (e.g., bridge, send, claim, create).
- ~<test scope>~ – The subject of the test (e.g., native ETH, ERC20, contract, RPC call).
- ~<conditions or properties>~ (optional) – Any constraints or test conditions (e.g., with low gas, after).
- ~[expected outcome]~ (only if needed) – If success/failure isn’t obvious (e.g., fails if contract is paused).

Examples:
- ~@test "bridge native ETH from L2 to L1"~
- ~@test "bridge native ETH from L2 to L1 without initial deposit fails"~
- ~@test "withdraw ERC20 and finalize after challenge period"~
- ~@test "deposit ETH on L2 with custom gas limit"~
- ~@test "replay transaction on L1 with same nonce reverts"~
- ~@test "bridge fails when contract is paused"~
- ~@test "query interop_getLatestSettledCertificateHeader on agglayer RPC returns expected fields"~


Best Practices:
- Start with a clear action (e.g., bridge, deposit, send).
- Be specific but concise—avoid vague test names.
- Do not include "test" in the name (it’s redundant).
- Use present tense ("bridge native ETH" not "bridging native ETH").
- Failure states should be explicit (e.g., "deposit fails when network ID is the current network").

Test names should be reviewed for clarity and adherence to this
standard before merging. Future linting may enforce a predefined set
of allowed actions to further standardize test naming.

* Project organization

All of the tests live in the [[./tests]] folder. We're still trying to
figure out the right organization, but for now please follow these
guidelines:

- Place your tests in sub-folders of the ~tests~ directory according
  to their dependencies.
  - ~agglayer/~ tests depend on access directly to the Agglayer RPC
    and the bridge
  - ~lxly/~ tests would depend on direct access to the bridge service
    and contracts, but might not need access to the Agglayer itself
  - ~pos/~ tests depend on a running PoS environment
- There are going to be some generic tests that can be reused across
  varied environments. In that case, we can name based on the test
  case itself
  - ~ethereum-test-cases/~ come from the standard Ethereume test
    suite, but could be run against any EVM RPC
  - ~polycli-loadtests/~ depend on running the PolyCLI load tests, but
    could also be run against any EVM RPC
- Bats files should contain test cases that can be run together:
  - Each file represents a logical collection of related tests
  - Try to keep each file small and focused (e.g., 5–15 tests) so it’s
    easier to run, maintain, and debug
  - If a particular test case is likely to break subsequent tests, it
    should be placed in its own file.
- Use descriptive naming for `.bats` files:
  - Each file name should reflect the test’s primary focus.

* Thinking about tagging

TODO - Like the overall project organization, there's more thinking
needed for test tags. Each test probably needs a least two tags to be
useful. E.g:

- Target (i.e. what is being tested)
  - ~agglayer~
  - ~lxly~
  - ~erigon~
  - ~evm~
  - ~pos~
  - ~heimdall~
- Type of test
  - ~regression~
  - ~smoke~
  - ~acceptance~
  - ~stress~
  - ~load~

* Common helper functions

TODO - We need to document the various helper functions. Some helpers
might be mandatory (enforced by code review) while others are there
for your convenience.
